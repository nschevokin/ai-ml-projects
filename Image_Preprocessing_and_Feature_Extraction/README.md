# Computer Vision Foundations — Image Preprocessing and Feature Extraction  

This project explores fundamental computer vision techniques for image enhancement, transformation, and feature extraction using **OpenCV** and **NumPy**. It forms the foundation for later deep learning models such as YOLOv8.  

## Overview  
The project demonstrates key preprocessing and feature-engineering steps commonly used in AI-based vision pipelines, including noise reduction, colour space transformations, and gradient-based edge detection.  

## ⚙️ Methodology  
The notebook covers:  
- **Image Enhancement** — histogram equalisation, blurring, and sharpening.  
- **Colour Space Conversions** — RGB, HSV, and grayscale representations.  
- **Edge & Feature Detection** — Sobel, Canny, and contour extraction.  
- **Morphological Operations** — dilation, erosion, and masking for segmentation tasks.  
- **Feature Representation** — pixel intensity histograms and statistical feature maps.  

## Technologies  
`Python` · `OpenCV` · `NumPy` · `Matplotlib` · `Scikit-Image`  

## Results  
- Visual comparison of multiple preprocessing pipelines.  
- Extracted robust visual features for use in object detection and classification models.  
- Provided modular functions reusable in future AI/ML projects.
