    "As the task ask for the project to be coincisive all of the tries with different techniques have been deleted, but here is a list of what has been tried and the encountered problems:\n",
    "- Template Matching: different tecniques of template matching has been tried, among which ZNCC gave the best results, especially in scene/models with intensity changes, however it struggled with different scale models like scene_27, and other cases\n",
    "- DBSCAN: During the exploration to improve SIFT method, DBSCAN has been used after the keypoints matching phase, as sometimes there were keypoints really off, from the actual model, using DBSCAN, in particular its property of eliminating outliers helped generating better homographies, however the cluster of points were different for some pairs of model/scene, which led to be impossible to find the best parameter, then, by tuning more accuratelty parameters of the SIFT model the outliers points problem has been solved anyway, without the necessity of DBSCAN.\n",
    "- Hough Transform: Another exploration to improve the SIFT method went through the usage of Hough transform, in particular, the idea was to pre-compute for each scene all possible book instances (of rectangular shape), and then run a simpler SIFT on the found rectangular shapes"
